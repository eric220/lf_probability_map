  Description:
    Abstract: This project is a cooperative effort between NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, and the National Geophysical Data Center, to produce benthic habitat maps and georeferenced imagery for Puerto Rico.  This project was conducted in support of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
    Purpose: This project was conducted in support of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force. For more information see http://coralreef.gov
  Time_Period_of_Content:
    Currentness_Reference: Ground condition at date photos were taken (Feb, Mar, and Dec 1999).  It should be noted that this season is in general dominated by more energetic sea conditions.  This results in temporary erosion of beaches and other coastal features.  Eroded beaches often experience accretion of sand during less energetic seasons.  Maps reflect only the conditions at the time of the photos.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Thematic accuracy was determined by comparison to field points and found to be 93.6% overall (% of ground truth sites correctly attributed in the habitat map).
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygons were delineated from orthophotos directly into a GIS using ArcView.  Attribution of polygon types was accomplished in ArcView as well.  A careful review of the finished polygon coverage was done to ensure that all labels were complete and accurate.
  Completeness_Report: Data is complete.  All interpretable habitats were mapped and peer reviewed by a panel of local experts familiar with the project area.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Polygons were digitized directly from orthophotos with spatial accuracy between 1 and 9 m and are believed to inherit this spatial accuracy.

      Source_Contribution: Benthic features were interpreted and mapped from NOS aerial photos
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Ground control points, camera calibration data, and USGS DTM data were used to orthorectify 500 dpi scans of the aerial photos using Socet Set Version 4.2.1. Orthorectified images were then loaded into ArcView 3.2 with the Image Analyst and Habitat Digitizer Extensions activated.  This allowed the photointerpreter to interpret features, delineate and attribute benthic habitat directly into a digital reference system.  The data were saved as ArcView shapefiles.
